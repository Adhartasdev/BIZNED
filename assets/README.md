### Specific Test User UX response:

* **Hotel management expert, female, aged 24**:
She stated that as a real estate professional she perfectly understood the range of services that the site offered and that it was logical for her to both navigate and understand the different pages on the website. In addition, she stated that the contact form should not be placed on each website, just as the Developerâ€™s mentor. So that was corrected. 

* **Financial management and Real Estate student, male, aged 19**:
He stated that the website was clear and intuitive in its details. He suggested that further developments, including a portfolio would be a plus. However, the purpose of the website is clearly demonstrated and inspires confidence in the business at hand. He admitted that as an investor this would demonstrate performance and that the website has proper CTAs.
